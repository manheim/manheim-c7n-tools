0.10.1 (2020-05-08)
-------------------

* Add ``jsonpointer`` to requirements.

0.10.0 (2020-05-06)
-------------------

**Important:** In following upstream c7n's `0.9.1.0 release <https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian/releases/tag/0.9.1.0>`__, this release drops support for Python 2.7. A modern version of Python 3 is now required.

* Upgrade `c7n-mailer <https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian/tree/master/tools/c7n_mailer>`__ requirement from 0.5.7 to 0.6.0.
* Upgrade ``c7n`` requirement from 0.8.46.0 to 0.9.1.0.
* Switch TravisCI tests from py36 and py37 to py37 and py38.
* Update vendored-in ``mugc`` with latest upstream version, for compatibility with above changes.

0.9.2 (2020-04-20)
------------------

* Add ``m2r`` package as dependency, for Sphinx docs builds.

0.9.1 (2020-04-20)
------------------

* If the ``policy_source_paths`` configuration option is specified, have policygen include a column showing which source(s) a policy came from in ``policies.rst``.
* Fix bug in ``dryrun-diff`` step where it would fail on an initial, empty S3 bucket.

0.9.0 (2020-04-08)
------------------

* Previously, manheim-c7n-tools set c7n-mailer's ``templates_folders`` configuration option to ``/manheim_c7n_tools/manheim_c7n_tools/mailer-templates`` if that directory exists, or to the absolute path to a ``mailer-templates`` directory inside the ``manheim_c7n_tools`` installation otherwise. This behavior was largely based on the legacy hard-coded templates directory. Now that c7n-mailer template locations are more flexible, this behavior has been updated to (in order of evaluation):

  * Use the ``templates_folders`` option from the ``mailer_config`` section of ``manheim-c7n-tools.yml``, if present. Otherwise, start with an empty list.
  * Prepend ``./mailer-templates`` if it exists.
  * Prepend ``/manheim_c7n_tools/manheim_c7n_tools/mailer-templates`` to the list, if it exists.
  * Prepend ``mailer-templates`` directory inside the ``manheim_c7n_tools`` installation, if it exists.

0.8.6 (2020-04-07)
------------------

* Fix bug in 0.8.5 - mailer template loading logic was missing ``policies/`` directory prefix.

0.8.5 (2020-04-06)
------------------

* Update ``policygen`` to also handle layering of ``mailer-templates`` directory contents from ``policy_source_paths`` into ``./mailer-templates``.
* Fixes `#23 <https://github.com/manheim/manheim-c7n-tools/issues/23>`_ - Document ``cleanup_notify`` config parameter in example ``manheim-c7n-tools.yml`` files and default it to an empty list.
* Fixes `#24 <https://github.com/manheim/manheim-c7n-tools/issues/24>`_ - Remove requirement that us-east-1 must be first configured region, or configured at all.

0.8.4 (2020-04-01)
------------------

* ``errorscan`` - Warn on missing SQS dead letter queue instead of failing, to support deployments that only run mailer in one region.

0.8.3 (2020-03-26)
------------------

* **Bug Fix:** Handle all ``account_id`` fields as strings. These were previously incorrectly handled as numeric fields, which prevented working with accounts having IDs that start with zero. The ``account_id`` field in your ``manheim-c7n-tools.yml`` file should be quoted as a string.
* Stop building c7n API docs ourselves, now that upstream API docs are fixed.

0.8.2 (2020-03-20)

0.7.3 (2019-06-25)
------------------

* Fix ArgumentParser error preventing ``dryrun-diff`` from being run as standalone entrypoint (as opposed to ``manheim-c7n-runner`` step).
* Fix Python3 error in ``dryrun-diff``.

0.7.2 (2019-06-24)
